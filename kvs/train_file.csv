13,"Unlike Most of the Rechargeable Battery cases, PowerBear Lasts up to 2 whole days. It does not heat up like most of the other ones, and I was completely fascinated by the ultra light and sleek design for the case. Before I was using the Mophie case but I could not wear it often because it was like having a hot brick in your pocket, Hence I had to always leave it at home.On the contrary, with PowerBear, I never take it off because I can not even tell the difference. Also it is build in a super STRONG manner and even though I dropped my phone a few times, its shock resistant technology will not let a single thing happen to the case or the phone. The PowerBear case became an extension to my phone that I never have to take off because when I charge it at night, it charges both my phone and the case, and I have battery life for more than two days. I was also shocked to hear all the positive compliments I was hearing from people at my job, fitness center, and throughout the community. Everybody was loving the case, and what they do not know is that it cost  me 60 % CHEAPER then all the other brand.

44,"I could only give this USB car charger 2 stars because although it worked fine for about 3 months, it subsequently died on me.Pros:-Has 2 USB ports for charging, one (the top) is 2.1 amps.  The bottom slot is lower, presumably 1 or 1.5 amps.-Fits well in my charging socket - holds tight.  I have had some that were loose in my charging socket.-Works well to charge my iPhone in the top slot and the bottom slot works with most Android phones, except the veryery high end ones.-Has a blue LED light to tell you it is on and ready to charge.-The USB sockets seem to be well made and tightly fit all my cables.-Pretty solid construction.-It cost less than $2.Cons:-It died on me after 3 months.I had really enjoyed using this USB charger.  It rapidly charged my iPhone and worked well with charging the phones of my family and friends.  The two slot design makes this design veryery handy; with a 1 slot design, no one else can charge their device unless I remove my cord.  Of course, after this charger died, I had to go back to the 1 slot design I was using before.After 3 months, I began to notice the LED light flickering.  It was less than a week later that is quit working permanently.  I am not sure what the problem was - faulty wiring, bad design, I guess I will never know.  I thought about getting another since they are so cheap, but then I thought better of it.  Maybe they are so cheap because they are simply disposable after a short period of time.For whatever reason, it died and I was forced to look for another 2 slot design - I have not found one in my price range yet.","[('sure', 0.5), ('tight', -0.17857142857142858), ('short', 0.0), ('seem', 0.0), ('cheap', 0.4), ('tell', 0.0), ('range', 0.0), ('go', 0.0), ('really', 0.2), ('well', 0.0), ('tightly', -0.17857142857142858), ('top', 0.5), ('price', 0.0), ('notice', 0.0), ('quit', 0.0), ('solid', 0.0), ('charged', 0.0), ('made', 0.0), ('bad', -0.6999999999999998), ('forced', -0.30000000000000004), ('period', 0.0), ('design', 0.0), ('high', 0.16), ('guess', 0.0), ('pro', 0.0), ('fine', 0.4166666666666667), ('found', 0.0), ('yet', 0.0), ('led', 0.0), ('back', 0.0), ('end', 0.0), ('remove', 0.0), ('reason', 0.0), ('fit', 0.4), ('device', 0.0), ('look', 0.0), ('charge', 0.0), ('better', 0.5), ('handy', 0.6), ('give', 0.0), ('cost', 0.0), ('light', 0.4)]","[('bad', 0.6999999999999998)]","[('sure', 0.5), ('bad', -0.6999999999999998), ('fit', 0.4), ('cheap', 0.4), ('high', 0.16), ('better', 0.5), ('handy', 0.6), ('fine', 0.4166666666666667), ('light', 0.4), ('really', 0.2)]",[0.26151515151515153],Negative,Positive

205,Very satisfied with my purchase. The quality is good and the shipping is quick. The case provides enough friction to enable a good grip on the phone. TPU (the plastic material where the case is made of) veryirtually resists oil and dust. I used to have an Otter box for my other phone. The protection is excellent BUT the silicone attracts dust like crazy. The S-Style pattern at the back is more of a personal taste - some people like it but some other may not. To me it adds some flavor to an otherwise plain black case. The protection on all 4 sides on the front panel looks sufficient (anyone dare to slam your phone on the floor to test it out?).
